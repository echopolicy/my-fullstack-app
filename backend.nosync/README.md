# Backend API Documentation

This is the backend part of the fullstack application, built using Node.js and Express.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

   The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /api/example**: This is an example endpoint. Replace with your actual API routes.

## Folder Structure

- `src/app.js`: Main application file where the Express server is set up.
- `src/routes/index.js`: Contains the route definitions for the API.
